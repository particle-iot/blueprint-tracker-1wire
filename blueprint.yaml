  This project demonstrates how to extend the functionality of Tracker One by adding 1-Wire sensors for temperature monitoring. It includes methods for using the M8 connector, interfacing with 5V I2C devices, and leveraging the DS2482-100 I2C to 1-Wire interface. With this setup, multiple DS18B20 temperature sensors can be connected and used to add custom data to location publishes, ideal for applications requiring extended environmental monitoring over long distances.
